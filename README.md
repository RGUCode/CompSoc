# May Day Tapestry

**Help us create a Spring-time tapestry and learn a bit of GitHub along the way!**

## Where to Start

Firstly, download the code by clicking the green *Clone or Download* button above. 

Open up `tapestry.html` in a browser and notice there are a number of empty cells. 

Choose one, and add your own code by editing `tapestry.html` in your favourite editor. 

What to add?
* An image
* An SVG graphic
* ASCII art
* ... anything you like!

Keep it spring-themed - can't wait to see what you add. 

## How to Update the Repository

Now that you've written code, time to upload it back into the repository so the world can see it. 

If you know how, go ahead and commit your changes directly to master. 

If you need a quick tutorial, there's a few ways to do it:

* Drag your new `tapestry.html` file into this page and select *Commit directly to master*. 
* or
* Learn a bit of command line Git with this [handy tutorial!](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
